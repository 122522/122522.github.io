      <span>Thank you for allowing me to join in the fun; I may have not appear to be particularly grateful or enthusiastic, but I am, and it is important that you know that.
      </span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>This was fascinating. Although a simple gesture, it has managed to become an opportunity and foundation for me to take courage and express myself—as well as, to a degree, connect with others; and furthermore, indulge, exercise, and amplify my enthusiasm in striving to become a better person within the bounds society—all incredible things which are truly of value—perhaps unbeknownst to you up until now. Not only that, it also made me see a lot more things about benevolence and the beauty of putting effort in making a responsible and desirable person out of oneself in some way, as well as reassure and remind me of good things. That is why, I greatly appreciate the time and thought you put into coming up with the idea, as well as reaching out and considering to include me in it. I am immensely thankful for these efforts and the mere act of consideration. 人(_ _*)</span>

      <span>It felt very welcoming that I was certain I would shed tears of joy capable of repopulating and restoring the Amazon forest to its former glory.</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>Once again, Merry Christmas, Jea! (￣▽￣)/</span>

Your cooperation in this matter would be highly appreciated. I also decided to keep this site perpetuate. This means that even after this particular Christmas season of year 2022 concludes, the essence of and the sentiments engraved and dedicated to this site will endure and continue to persist in the years ahead, hopefully to the celebration of future Christmases.</i>

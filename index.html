      <br>
      <span>Thank you for allowing me to join in the fun; I may have not appear to be particularly grateful or enthusiastic, but I am, and it is important that you know that.
      </span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>This was fascinating. Although a simple gesture, it has managed to become an opportunity and foundation for me to express myself and, to a degree, connect with others—as well as indulge, exercise, and further amplify my enthusiasm in striving to become a better person—perhaps unbeknownst to you up until now. Not only did it put me in the process—it also made me think about pursuing happiness not just for myself—but also for the sake of others (i.e. devoting time and effort specifically for providing others with a proper and commendable Christmas present, something that could make them happy, if anything)—which is certainly something that's truly of value.</span> 
      <br>
      <br>  
      <span>Overall, it made me see a lot more things about benevolence and the beauty of making a responsible person out of oneself in some way, as well as reassure and remind me of good things. That is why, I greatly appreciate the time and thought you put into coming up with the idea, as well as reaching out and considering to include me in it. I am immensely thankful for these efforts and the mere act of consideration.<span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>It felt very welcoming that I was certain I would shed tears of joy capable of repopulating and restoring the Amazon forest to its former glory</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>Once again, Merry Christmas, Jea! (￣▽￣)/</span>
